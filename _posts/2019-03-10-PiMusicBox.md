# Introduction

Make your Raspberry Pi stream!
Welcome to the Swiss Army Knife of streaming music using the Raspberry Pi. With Pi MusicBox, you can create a cheap (Sonos-like) standalone streaming music player for Spotify, Google Music, SoundCloud, Webradio, Podcasts and other music from the cloud. Or from your own collection from a device in your network. It won't drain the battery of your phone when playing. The music won't stop if you play a game on your phone.

Connect a 25$ Raspberry Pi to your (DIY) audio system, easily configure MusicBox and go! Control the music from your couch using a phone, tablet, laptop or PC, no tinkering required. AirPlay and DLNA streaming also included!
