# Introduction

<p>Beginners should start with NOOBS &#8211; New Out Of the Box Software. You can purchase a pre-installed NOOBS SD card from many retailers, such as <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/noobs-8gb-sd-card">Pimoroni</a>, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1583">Adafruit</a> and <a href="http://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-sd-cards-and-adapters/products/noobs-preinstalled-sd-card">The Pi Hut</a>, or download NOOBS below and follow the <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up">software setup guide</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/videos/#noobs-setup">NOOBS setup guide video</a> in our help pages.</p>
<p><strong>NOOBS</strong> is an easy operating system installer which contains <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian</a> and <a href="https://libreelec.tv/">LibreELEC</a>. It also provides a selection of alternative operating systems which are then downloaded from the internet and installed.</p>
<p><strong>NOOBS Lite</strong> contains the same operating system installer without Raspbian pre-loaded. It provides the same operating system selection menu allowing Raspbian and other images to be downloaded and installed.</p>
