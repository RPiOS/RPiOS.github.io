# Introduction

SARPi Downloads
In this SARPi downloads section you will find:

• SARPi installer images and system packages for installing Slackware ARM or upgrading the kernel, modules, and firmware.
• Slackware ARM -current packages supporting SARPi Projects.
• Slackware ARM 14.2 packages supporting SARPi Projects.

The SARPi installer images and packages have been created specifically for the Raspberry Pi 1, 2, 3. The installer images incorporate the kernel_sarpi, kernel-modules-sarpi, sarpi-boot-firmware, and sarpi-hacks packages. The installers and packages are all built on Raspberry Pis running Slackware ARM, using the official Slackware ARM mini root filesystem and Raspberry Pi Foundation GitHub repository sources. To ensure and maintain absolute compatibility, none of the installers or packages that the SARPi Project provides are cross-compiled or created on any other hardware platform.

Slackware ARM -current hard float port and 14.2 soft float port installer images are available. If you don't know what the differences are, or aren't sure which version is best for you, there's a good soft and hard float FAQ by MoZes which may be helpful.
