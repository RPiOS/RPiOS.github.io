Manjaro is an accessible, friendly, open-source Linux distribution and community. Based on Arch Linux, Manjaro provides all the benefits of cutting-edge software combined with a focus on getting started quickly, automated tools to require less manual intervention, and help readily available when needed. Manjaro is suitable for both newcomers and experienced Linux users.

Manjaro is an excellent entry-point into the Linux world. Unlike proprietary operating systems, Manjaro gives you full control over your hardware, without restrictions. This makes it ideal for people who want to learn how Linux works and how it is different to other operating systems. From this perspective, Manjaro is suitable for beginners similar to the way an Arduino is an excellent entry-point to embedded hardware development.

Manjaro is not a consumer-oriented operating system. You have full control and you will not be prevented from breaking your own installation - but then again, breaking things and fixing them is half of the fun! On the other hand, if you are happy with the way it works you donâ€™t have to change a thing.

Manjaro can represent a perfect middle-ground for experienced Linux users, those who want good performance, full control, and cutting-edge software but also a degree of software version stability.
