<p>FreeBSD is an Open Source, standards-compliant Unix-like
      operating system for x86 (both 32 and 64 bit), <span class="trademark">ARM</span>®, AArch64,
      <span class="trademark">RISC-V</span>®, <span class="trademark">MIPS</span>®, <span class="trademark">POWER</span>®, <span class="trademark">PowerPC</span>®, and Sun <span class="trademark">UltraSPARC</span>®
      computers.  It provides all the features that are
      nowadays taken for granted, such as preemptive multitasking,
      memory protection, virtual memory, multi-user facilities, SMP
      support, all the Open Source development tools for different
      languages and frameworks, and desktop features centered around
      X Window System, KDE, or GNOME.  Its particular strengths
      are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Liberal Open Source license</em></span>,
	  which grants you rights to freely modify and extend
	  its source code and incorporate it in both Open Source
	  projects and closed products without imposing
	  restrictions typical to copyleft licenses, as well
	  as avoiding potential license incompatibility
	  problems.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Strong TCP/IP networking</em></span>
	  <a id="idp45204600" class="indexterm"></a> - FreeBSD
	  implements industry standard protocols with ever
	  increasing performance and scalability.  This makes
	  it a good match in both server, and routing/firewalling
	  roles - and indeed many companies and vendors use it
	  precisely for that purpose.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Fully integrated OpenZFS support</em></span>,
	  including root-on-ZFS, ZFS Boot Environments, fault
	  management, administrative delegation, support for jails,
	  FreeBSD specific documentation, and system installer
	  support.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Extensive security features</em></span>,
	  from the Mandatory Access Control framework to Capsicum
	  capability and sandbox mechanisms.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Over 30 thousand prebuilt
	    packages</em></span> for all supported architectures,
	  and the Ports Collection which makes it easy to build your
	  own, customized ones.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Documentation</em></span> - in addition
	  to Handbook and books from different authors that cover
	  topics ranging from system administration to kernel
	  internals, there are also the <a class="citerefentry" href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=man&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=freebsd-release-ports"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">man</span>(1)</span></a> pages, not only
	  for userspace daemons, utilities, and configuration files,
	  but also for kernel driver APIs (section 9) and individual
	  drivers (section 4).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Simple and consistent repository structure
	    and build system</em></span> - FreeBSD uses a single
	  repository for all of its components, both kernel and
	  userspace.  This, along with an unified and easy to
	  customize build system and a well thought out development
	  process makes it easy to integrate FreeBSD with build
	  infrastructure for your own product.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Staying true to Unix philosophy</em></span>,
	  preferring composability instead of monolithic <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">all
	    in one</span>&#8221;</span> daemons with hardcoded behavior.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a id="idp45224952" class="indexterm"></a>
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Binary compatibility</em></span> with Linux,
	  which makes it possible to run many Linux binaries without
	  the need for virtualisation.</p></li></ul></div><p>FreeBSD is based on the 4.4BSD-Lite<a id="idp45229944" class="indexterm"></a> release from Computer
      Systems Research Group (CSRG)<a id="idp45232120" class="indexterm"></a> at the University of California at Berkeley, and
      carries on the distinguished tradition of BSD systems
      development.  In addition to the fine work provided by CSRG,
      the FreeBSD Project has put in many thousands of man-hours
      into extending the functionality and fine-tuning the system
      for maximum performance and reliability
      in real-life load situations.  FreeBSD offers performance and
      reliability on par with other Open Source and commercial
      offerings, combined with cutting-edge features not available
      anywhere else.</p>
