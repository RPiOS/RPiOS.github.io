Volumio is a Free and Open Source Linux Distribution, designed and fine-tuned exclusively for music playback.
It runs on a variety of devices, typically small and cheap computers like Raspberry PI, but also on low power PCs, Notebooks or Multimedia PCs.

By flashing (installing) Volumio on any of this platforms, it will then become a headless Audiophile Music Player. Headless means that the only  way to control it will be with another device, such as a Smartphone, Tablet, PC or anything that has a browser.

This is made possible by Volumioâ€™s UI: a web applications that runs on any device with a browser, and that allows an easy and intuitive control of your playback sessions. All communications between the Web App and Volumio will happen through your home network.
