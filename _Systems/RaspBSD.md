RaspBSD is a volunteer project headed by FreeBSD Committer Brad Davis (brd@).

The Goal of this project is to build images easily useable by anyone. Sometimes that means images preloaded with different packages to help new users get started. Initially they will start off pretty basic, but will expand in different directions to support different goals. Initial goals include Education and Entertainment. All of our images are built using publicly available tools and any enhancements will be pushed upstream.

If you like what we are doing, please consider donating to the FreeBSD Foundation.
