<p>Ubuntu Core, a minimalist rendition of Ubuntu, is a lightweight, transactionally updated operating system designed for deployments on embedded and IoT devices, cloud and more. It runs a new breed of super-secure, remotely upgradeable Linux app packages known as snaps.</p>
<p>The strict separation between kernel and device drivers, OS and applications means embedded engineers and application developers can easily work in parallel.</p>
