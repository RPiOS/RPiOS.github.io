<p><strong>Raspbian</strong> is the Foundation&#8217;s official supported operating system. You can install it with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/">NOOBS</a> or download the image below and follow our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>Raspbian comes pre-installed with plenty of software for education, programming and general use. It has Python, Scratch, Sonic Pi, Java and more.</p>
<p>The Raspbian with Desktop image contained in the ZIP archive is over 4GB in size, which means that these archives use features which are not supported by older unzip tools on some platforms. If you find that the download appears to be corrupt or the file is not unzipping correctly, please try using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7Zip</a> (Windows) or <a href="http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html">The Unarchiver</a> (Macintosh). Both are free of charge and have been tested to unzip the image correctly.</p>
