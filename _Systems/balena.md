In our quest to build balenaCloud, a platform that brings the tools of modern software development to the world of connected hardware, we started by porting Docker to ARM chips in 2013. We soon realised that we also needed an operating system optimized for the use case: a minimal OS ideal for running containers on embedded devices.<br/>
BalenaOS supports almost 20 distinct device types, has a robust networking and provisioning story, emphasizes reliability over long periods operation, and enables a productive developer workflow. Weâ€™ve been running balenaOS as part of the balenaCloud platform for years and are now releasing it as an independent operating system, so that others can benefit and contribute to running containers on connected devices.
